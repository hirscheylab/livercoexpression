# Gene coexpression correlation analysis from human liver biopsies
Code for gene correlation is available within this repository. To summarize, liver gene expression values, IDs, and descriptions were downloaded from [NCBI GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE14520). Data were cleaned, tidied, and prepared for analysis using the `tidyverse`. Liver samples were filtered to include only non-tumor samples. A correlation matrix was built to identify similar patterns of hepatic expression for all genes compared to all genes using `corrr`. Probe IDs for SIRT3, 4, and 5 were queried and summarized for the top 20 gene correlations. To measure the distribution of correlation coefficients, r^2 values were resampled from the entire matrix to generate 1000 'virtual' gene lists using `moderndive`. Mean and standard deviations were calculated from this virtual set. A standard deviation threshold of +/- two standard deviations was set, and the resulting gene correlations with each gene of interest greater than or less than the threshold were considered to be statistically unlikely by chance, and then queried for gene set enrichment analysis.
